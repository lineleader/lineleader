#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bump-deployed-version.sh — rewrite the LINELEADER_VERSION= line in the
# committed dockhand env file (deploy/percival/lineleader.env by default).
#
# This is the second half of a release: scripts/release.sh tags a version
# and pushes it, CI (.github/workflows/release.yml) builds and publishes
# the image, and then CI runs this script and commits the result to main.
# dockhand polls main on a cron and redeploys once it sees the new commit
# — bumping this file *is* the deploy trigger, so the rewrite has to be
# exact and idempotent (a retried or re-dispatched CI job must be able to
# run this again safely).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bump-deployed-version.sh <version> [--file PATH]
#
#   <version>       version to deploy, e.g. v0.1.0 (must match
#                   ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$, same as scripts/release.sh)
#
# Options:
#   --file PATH     env file to rewrite (default:
#                   deploy/percival/lineleader.env, resolved relative to
#                   the repo root, not the current working directory)
#   -h, --help      show this help
#
# Behavior:
#   - Only the LINELEADER_VERSION= line is rewritten; every other byte in
#     the file (comments, blank lines, other keys, trailing newline) is
#     preserved exactly. scripts/rollout.sh step 3 does the same kind of
#     in-place rewrite, over ssh, against a live host; this does it
#     locally.
#   - If LINELEADER_VERSION is absent from the file, this fails rather
#     than appending it — a missing key almost always means the wrong
#     file was given, and silently appending could point a deploy at the
#     wrong stack's env file.
#   - If the file is already at the requested version, this makes no
#     change, prints a message, and exits 0. This must be idempotent: a
#     re-run CI job (retry, or workflow_dispatch after a partial failure)
#     must not fail just because a previous run already made the change.
